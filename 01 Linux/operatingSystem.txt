Q. what are the tasks of os?
    1. allocation of tasks to cpu.

    2. memory management: if there is no enough space in the memory that it does meemory swaping and it is a slow process.
    in this process it clears the tasks from ram and store in rom and make the space for another task.

    3. manage file system and sotres everything in tree like structure.

    4. management of input output devices.

    5.Handle security and authentication.

    6. Kernel is the heart of os. it does all the tasks stated above. it is simply a code.

    7. os is a layerd system.
=> when kernel is layerd with application it becomes os most of the time we are using linux os. and its distributions, even the andriod in mobile.

=> macos and ios works differently they works on darwin kernel.

There are two types of operating system for computers:
    1. desktop based
    2. server based

server based os are fast and secure because they doesn't havin ui.we just directly login to them using command line interface.

unix is the oldest thing. mac and linux are coming from here.
now we maintain a standard for os and it is posix.
