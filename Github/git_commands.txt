# git push  --set-upstream origin master
what it does ?
does it create the local git branch to the remote git branch ?

#when implementing new featuer or fixing an bug try to do it with a  new branch it is  the good practice.
fomrat: feature/feature_name or bugfix/bug_name


what is the Trunk based development ?
on a push to the main branch it will test build and deploy the code.

Another method is the feature based development but it is not the good practice.

Trunk based development: best suites to the ci/cd pipeline.

# do Delete the branch when the feature and the bug fixes is done.
once the the remote branch is delete using ui , we need to delete the local branch as well. using git branch -d branch_name

# what is git -r (rebase ) while pushing ?
is it an alternative of git stash or anyting else.
